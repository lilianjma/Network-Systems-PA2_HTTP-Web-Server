This is a longer random text file.
It contains multiple lines of text that donâ€™t really mean anything.
Just some random content to fill up space.

Did you know that the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog?
Yes, that sentence contains every letter in the English alphabet.

Let's add some more randomness:
- Apples are red.
- Bananas are yellow.
- The sun is bright.
- Water is wet.

Now, some ASCII art:

   (o.o) 
   <) )>
    - -

Isn't that great?

Thanks for reading this file!
